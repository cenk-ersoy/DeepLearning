# DeepLearning
This section includes Jupyter notebooks related to Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Detailed explanations to the examples listed below are added by me.
- **ANN.ipynb**: This example is from the Udemy course titled "Deep Learning A-Z: Hands on Artificial Neural Networks" by Kirill Eremenko. It is a classification problem using Artificial Neural Networks and Keras to predict churn at a bank.
- **ANN_Example_2.ipynb**: This code is from "Python - All in one for Dummies" by John Shovic and Alan Simpson. It is a classification problem. The example uses Fashion MNIST dataset to determine if an input picture belows to a set of trained images (shirt, trouser etc).
- **ANN_for_binary_classification.ipynb**: The example is from "Practical Machine Learning with Python" by Dipanjan Sarkar, Raghav Bali and Tushar Sharma. It is a classifier problem related to breast cancer detection.
- **CNN.ipynb**: This example is from the Udemy course titled "Deep Learning A-Z: Hands on Artificial Neural Networks" by Kirill Eremenko.This is a classic, binary classifier problem where we decide if an input picture is either cat or a dog.
- **CNN_example_2.ipynb**: (TO BE CORRECTED LATER)
- **CNN_example_3.ipynb**: This code is from "Python - All in one for Dummies". It is a classification problem. The example uses Fashion MNIST dataset to determine if an input picture belows to a set of trained images (shirt, trouser etc).
