# DeepLearning
This section includes Jupyter notebooks related to Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Detailed explanations to the examples listed below are added by me.
- **ANN.ipynb**: This example is from the Udemy course titled "Deep Learning A-Z: Hands on Artificial Neural Networks" by Kirill Eremenko. It is a classification problem using Artificial Neural Networks and Keras to predict churn at a bank.
- **ANN_Example_2.ipynb**: This code is from "Python - All in one for Dummies" by John Shovic and Alan Simpson. It is a classification problem. The example uses Fashion MNIST dataset to determine if an input picture belows to a set of trained images (shirt, trouser etc).
- **ANN_for_binary_classification.ipynb**: The example is from "Practical Machine Learning with Python" by Dipanjan Sarkar, Raghav Bali and Tushar Sharma. It is a classifier problem related to breast cancer detection.
- **CNN_example_1.ipynb**: This example is from the Udemy course titled "Deep Learning A-Z: Hands on Artificial Neural Networks" by Kirill Eremenko.This is a classic, binary classifier problem where we decide if an input picture is either cat or a dog.
- **CNN_example_2.ipynb**: This example is from the Udemy course titled "Deep Learning A-Z - Handson ANNs" It is the result of the competition among students. The article can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/learn/lecture/7023358#questions/2276518
- **CNN_example_3.ipynb**: This code is from "Python - All in one for Dummies". It is a classification problem. The example uses Fashion MNIST dataset to determine if an input picture belows to a set of trained images (shirt, trouser etc).

- **Keras_for_Image_Processing.ipynb**: This code uses Keras and ResNet50 to classify a simple image.
=======
- **RNN_example1.ipynb**: This example is from the Udemy course titled "Deep Learning A-Z - Handson ANNs" by Kirill Eremenko. It will predict the stock price for Google for the next 1 month (Jan 2017), given stock price data for the last 5 years (Jan 2012 to Dec 2016), using LSTM that predicts the upward and downward trends in Google stock price.
